This is a Daily Expense Calculator Project...

Here you can select a date (before today) and then add the expense spent that day.

Steps to use:
1. Select the date (default is the present day's date according to the system time)
2. Then type in the expense spent
3. Then click on add to database
4. You can display the last ten records and the total expense in the last ten records
5. You can update or delete a record by typing in the ID of the record and then clicking on the respective button
6. You can also view all the records in the database by clicking on show all records

NOTE: Deleting the 'expense.db' file from the directory will result in loss of all data...
      The program will then create a new clean database file.
